# Sierpinski Pyramid

## Description
This project creates an interactive 3D application using Python, Pygame, and OpenGL.
It features dynamic texture mapping and interactive control to visualize a Sierpinski pyramid and a textured floor.
The application allows users to manipulate the view and level of recursion through keybord and mouse inputs.

## Features
- Dynamic texture mapping: Apply textures to a 3D Sierpinski pyramid and a floor plane.
- Interactive controls:
  - Camera movements with arrow keys.
  - Zoom in/out with 'I' and 'O' keys or mouse scroll.
  - Toggle textures on/off with the 'S' key.
  - Adjust recursion level of the pyramid with 'M' (increase) and 'L' (decrease).
- User manual: Popup instructions available by pressing 'P' during runtime.
